# Stat-Tools
General Statistical Tools

Idea: create python script which accepts the name of a CSV file and provides useful statistical breakdown of data. For each numeric column:
- Five number summary: (min, lower quantile, median, upper quantile, max)
- (mean, sd, skewness, kurtosis)
- best fitting distribution of (geometric, Poisson, exponential, Gaussian). Need mechanism to decide between continous or discrete.
